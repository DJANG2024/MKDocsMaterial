## Overview of Visual Studio Code Docs

This documentation will guide you through setting up Visual Studio Code as an independent development environment for software development.

The purpose of this guide is to assist beginner developers with no prior experience or intermediate developers who are new to VS Code. This documentation will help your customize your development environment to tailor to your needs and enhance your productivity.

Topics covered in this guide include:
- Configuring GitHub repositories
- Setting up third-party extensions
- Customizing keyboard shortcuts

### Methods
This guide is written in Markdown language and utilizes [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to automatically generate a website for this documentation.

Our team takes advantage of several MkDocs features to improve the readability and user experience of the documentation. These include the use of admonitions, which help highlight important information, tips, and warnings, making it easier for users to navigate and absorb key points.

### How This Guide was created 
This guide was developed based on our research and own working knowledge of Visual Studio Code. Here are some of the key elements and processes involved in creating this guide.  

- Documentation Tool: The guide was written using Material for MkDocs, which allowed us to generate a static website. 

- Version Control: We used Git and GitHub for version control, allowing us to push changes, manage conflicts, and keep track of changes so that we could code simultaneously. 

- Communication: We communicated both in person and online to brainstorm, coordinate meetings and resolve git conflicts.

- Collaboration Tools: We worked together using Visual Studio Code for development and Discord for real-time communication and collaboration.

### MkDocs
This guide is written in Markdown language and uses Material for MkDocs to automatically generate a user-friendly website to enhance readability and the navigation of our documentation. 

- Markdown Language: The documentation was written using Markdown which allowed us to format fonts, whitespace and use the tools from Materials for Mkdocs. 

- MkDocs: A tool used to create a static website for the documentation, which allowed us to style and customize our layouts and implement navigations menus, admonitions and more. 

- Live Previews: During the development stage, we could see live previews of the changes being made to the documentation which helped speed up our workflow. 

### Visual Studio Code
For this guide, we used Visual Studio Code as the editor of choice to collaborate on this project. Visual Studio Code is a powerful editor that we hope to help others learn so that they can leverage it to increase their own productivity and collaboration. 


### Conclusion 
We hope that by creating this documentation on how to configure GitHub repositories, setup third party extensions and customize keyboard shortcuts you now have the tools to optimize your own development environment. 

Thank you so much for reading our guide and happy coding!
