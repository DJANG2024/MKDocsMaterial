Troubleshooting in Visual Studio Code involves identifying and diagnosing problems that prevent the application from functioning properly. Here are some common issues or problems that can be resolved:

| Issue                                | Possible Causes                                                                                     | Solutions                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Git Not Working in VS Code           | Git is not installed, misconfigured, or not added to the system path                               | Ensure Git is installed by running `git --version` in the terminal, configure it properly, and restart VS Code |
| GitHub Account Not Linking           | Incorrect or missing GitHub credentials, authentication issues, or Git configuration errors        | Ensure your GitHub credentials are correctly set up in VS Code. Your GitHub can be linked through the VS Code Settings |
| Extensions Not Working               | Corrupted installation, conflicting extensions, outdated version, or system issues                | Disable and re-enable the extension, check for updates, restart the application |
| Hotkeys Not Working after set-up     | There may be key conflicts if you set up more than one action for the same set of hotkeys          | Check and resolve key conflicts in the keyboard shortcuts settings (`Ctrl+K Ctrl+S`) in VS Code |
