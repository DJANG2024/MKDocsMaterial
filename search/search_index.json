The following technical terms are arranged in alphabetical order:</p> Terms Explanations Commit A snapshot of your repository at a specific time which records your progress. Commit message A message which explains the corresponding commit. Directory A file system structure that organizes and stores files and other directories, also known as a folder. Disable (extensions) Temporarily turning off an extension without uninstalling it, preventing it from running until re-enabled. Enable (extensions) Activating a previously disabled extension to restore its functionality. Extension A small add-ons package that enhances the functionality of software by adding new features or integrations. Extensions Marketplace A built-in platform in Visual Studio Code where users can browse, install, and manage extensions. Hotkey A combination of keys which will trigger a specific actions faster than using a mouse or other input devices. Integrated development environment A software application that provides comprehensive facilities for software development. Keybinding The assignment of an action to a specific keyboard shortcut, typically to enhance the speed and efficiency of performing that action. Key conflict A situation where multiple actions are assigned to the same keyboard shortcuts, resulting in malfunctions."},{"location":"Troubleshooting/","title":"Troubleshooting","text":"<p>This section identifies and diagnoses technical issues that may prevent the application from functioning properly. Below are some common problems you might have encountered:</p> Issues Possible Causes Solutions Unable to clone a GitHub repository to a local directory GitHyb repository URL is incorrect or not properly formatted. Double-check the repository URL. Ensure it ends with <code>.git</code>. \"Repository Already Exists\" or \"Directory Not Empty\" errors The destination directory in your local computer contains conflicting files. Clear the destination directory before cloning the repository. Unable to push commits to GitHub Your GitHub account is not configured properly in VS Code. Ensure your GitHub credentials are correctly set up in VS Code. If not, click on [View] \u2192 [Command Palette], and then select [GitHub: Sign in to GitHub] to reconfigure your GitHub account in VS Code. You do not have the write access to the remote repository. Check with the repository owner to confirm your access rights. Extensions not working There are corrupted installation, conflicting extensions, outdated version, or system issues. Disable and re-enable the extension, check for updates, and restart the application. Keyboard shortcuts not working Multiple actions are assigned to the same key combination. Resolve the key conflicts as instructed in Customized Keyboard Shortcuts. Unable to remove a keybinding There are bugs or technical issues with the keybinding configuration.
